## Web 'app deployed on Heroku!

#### Application :

#### Served by Flask, coded with Python and

#### JavaScript, presented by a Bootstrap template 

## CRUD messages and carousel

## Dynamic Bootstrap

#### The goal: To provide access to the actors of the innovation pole to a platform allowing to insert

#### multimedia content. The platform then allows to layout the content.

### Content added dynamically thanks to Vue.js and translated by Google Translate

### Flask: the server that presents us this on a platter!

#### With the logic of the Flask web server, our application has several routes that

#### were indicated to him. So at the loading of the page we use the first that is satisfied

#### to display the Bootstrap theme that it uses and contains different areas that different scripts know how to use.

#### The app reacts to user interactions! Jinja, inspired by Django, is a driving force

#### template that our program also uses to reduce the content of the page to the simple

#### body of it. The other information being stored in a layout, the legibility of the code is thus improved!

#### No Bootstrap theme seemed to meet the needs of the application. So we created

#### a simple interface using a carousel on a Bootstrap grid allowing a responsive interface.


#### The different sections of the page are presented in separate files allowing greater project readability and greater flexibility in iterative additions.
